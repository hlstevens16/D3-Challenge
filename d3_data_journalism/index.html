          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>For the In Poverty vs. Lacks Healthcare graph, there is a positive correlation for poverty percentage and lack of health insurance coverage. Massachusettes had the lowest percentage of lacking healthcare as they were one of the first states to expand and implement Medicaid coverage for those who fell in the gap.</p>

          <p>For the In Poverty vs. Smokes graph, those states that have highest poverty percentages also have highest smoking percentages. And same for the In Poverty vs. Obese graph, higher the poverty percentage, higher the obese percentage.</p>

          <p>For the Age vs. Obese graph, higher ages had higher obese rates. Smoking rates also rose with age. For Age vs Lacking Healthcare, the relationship was not positive. It was more of an inverse relationship where younger age groups had higher percentages of the population lacking healthcare. </p>
